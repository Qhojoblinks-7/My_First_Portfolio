                    About Me<br>
                    My name is Immanuel Eshun Quansah, and I am passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems, particularly in education and innovation across Africa. I am currently pursuing an HND in Computer Science at Accra Technical University, where I have been actively involved in projects that integrate technology into learning platforms, including a more user-friendly version of iCampus ATU and the AfriSo Digital Student Portal.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Through my work, I aim to bridge the gap between theoretical learning and practical application, ensuring students and educators have the tools and platforms necessary for success. My commitment to leveraging technology for good is also reflected in my role at Scribble Works Publishing, where we focus on creating educational materials and promoting lifelong learning. At Scribble Works, I contribute to advancing ed-tech innovations, ensuring our products and services align with our core valuesâ€”Professionalism, Respect, Integrity, Consistency, and Excellence (PRICE).

                <p>
                    In addition to my academic pursuits, I am deeply committed to the vision of building a better Africa through innovative tech solutions. From developing educational platforms to creating financial systems, my mission is to apply my software engineering skills to foster growth and development across the continent.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am always excited about new opportunities to collaborate on projects that contribute positively to society, and I look forward to continuing my journey of learning and making a meaningful impact.
